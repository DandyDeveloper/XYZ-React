# Frontend Stateless React SPA with Webpack bundler

Created specifically to support `1024x768` with minimal responsive design. 

## Start
Start the server with Webpack hot-loading: `npm install` & `npm start`. This will automatically open the local browser on port 3000 (localhost:3000). 

## Build
Run `npm run build` 

## [Demo](https://dandydeveloper.github.io/xyz-react.github.io/)
Note: Static assets don't work very well with Github pages. This would be better deployed with Nginx to handle static assets.
